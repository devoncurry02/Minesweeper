# Overview

This script runs Minesweeper with the built in terminal. At it's current stage, it creates a randomized matrix from three inputs: grid_height, grid_length, and number_of_mines. It then displays these in a grid structure. Another feature included in the Coordinates Class is the ability to convert a coordinate like "B5" to integers (55) and check if they are within the range of the grid displayed. Next, I want to add different colors to each number and X and then mask it so only one cell is revealed at a time.

This is a file to run Minesweeper in visual studio code.
